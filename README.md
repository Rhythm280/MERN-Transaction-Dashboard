# MERN Stack Transaction Dashboard

This project demonstrates a simple transaction dashboard application built with the MERN stack:

* **M**ongoDB: NoSQL database for storing transaction data.
* **E**xpress.js: Node.js web framework for building the backend API.
* **React:** JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Install Node.js and npm:** Download and install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd mern-transaction-dashboard
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
5. **Start MongoDB:** Strt your MongoDB server.
6. **Run the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```
7. **Run the client:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm start
   ```
This will start the development server, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
